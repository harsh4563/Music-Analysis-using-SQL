# Music-Analysis-using-SQL
The Music Analysis SQL Project is a database project that aims to analyze music data and provide insights into various aspects of music such as artist popularity, album sales, song popularity, and genre trends. This project uses SQL to manage the database and perform data analysis.

The project includes several tables representing different aspects of music data, such as artists, albums, songs, and genres, along with tables for sales data, streaming data, and other relevant data. These tables can be used to retrieve, filter, group, and sort data in various ways to uncover valuable insights into the music industry.

This project is suitable for music enthusiasts and professionals who wish to gain a better understanding of the music industry's inner workings and make informed decisions. To use this project, download the SQL files and import them into your preferred SQL database management system.

Happy analyzing!
